Writing Assignment ECO339H 2024/25
Announcement #1


The Writing Assignment is on Friday October 25, 2024. In   it you will be   asked   to   describe   and   explain a graph from our class notes, or   from the   textbook   in   one   of   the   chapters   we have covered. It is important that you have access to the textbook for this   assignment.
You may refer to the textbook and class notes as you prepare your answer. However, you   should   not view the notes you have taken in class, or BGLRS, describing the   figure   as   a   sufficient basis      for your answer. You will need to provide context of   why the figure is   interesting   or important, and you will need to define any economic terms that you use.
You will have a total of 1 hour and 25 minutes to complete   the   assignment.   The   allocation   of   time   is:
1.       15 minutes to review the assigned   figure   in the textbook   and   the   accompanying   text.
2.       1 hour to compose your description   and   explanation   of   the   figure
3.       10 minutes to upload your completed assignment to   Quercus   and   to   Crowdmark.
Your description and explanation of   the figure should be 400   words   maximum.   Any   text beyond 400 words will not be marked. It is easy to check your word count in   most   word processing software, but 400 words is approximately one page, double spaced.
This assignment is intended to help you develop your ability to   communicate   economic terms and analysis using words rather than diagrams and math. One way to get   in the right   frame   of   mind is to imagine you are explaining the figure to   a   colleague   at work who   has   not   taken   any      economics courses. They can follow a detailed   argument, but   do   not have   any prior knowledge   of   economic   terms.
To help you understand what is expected, below I provide an example response based on   a   figure   from Varian’s intermediate microeconomics   textbook.
A few things to notice:
You need to provide context for why the figure is interesting   or important.   Your   lecture notes,   the lecture summaries and the textbook   should help.
You need to explain in words any economic terms that you use.
You may need to define and use some economic terms that   are not   explicitly   part   of   the   figure (note here the concept of   elasticity is used to explain why the figure   is   important   even   though   the   elasticity of   demand is not used or demonstrated in the figure). You should not make explicit references to the figure.
You   will   be   graded   on   whether   your   interpretation   of   the   figure   is   correct, whether   you   provide compelling context for why the figure is interesting or   important,   on how   you   define   any   economic   terms   you   use   and   on   the   clarity   of   your   writing. The   grading   will   take   account代 写Writing Assignment ECO339H 2024/25 Announcement #1R

Here is the example. It is a figure which   demonstrates what   happens   to   a   firm’s   revenue   when   they change their price and face a downwards sloping   demand   curve   (e.g.,   a   monopolist).

This example response is 389 words:
"Will raising the price of   a good you sell raise total sales revenue? If   the   demand   curve   for your   product has a negative slope, the answer is not straightforward.   A negatively   sloped   demand curve   means   when   you   raise   your   price   consumers   will   buy   fewer   units   of   your   product   (and   when you lower the price they will buy more). If   the demand for the good you   sell is   negatively sloped, when you raise your price there are two effects on your sales revenue:   1)   you   will   sell   fewer units of   your product and the revenue on those units will be lost, and 2) you will   gain higher revenue on the units you continue to sell due to the higher price.   The   overall   effect   on   your total sales revenue will reflect the sum of   these two effects—which   is bigger? For   example, if   the revenue effect of   (1) is bigger, your total sales revenue will fall. How   do   you   know   when   the   effect   of   (1) or   the   effect   of   (2) is   bigger? The   elasticity   of   demand   can   help.   The   elasticity   of   demand   is   a   measure   of   how   responsive   your   consumers’ purchases   are   to   changes   in   the   price   of your good. The elasticity tells you something about how big the revenue   losses will be   from   effect (1) of   raising your price. If   the demand for your good is   “inelastic”, then   the revenue   loss by effect (1) will be less than the revenue gain by effect   (2)   and raising your price will   increase   total sales revenue. Inelastic demand means that the change in the number   of   units   consumers   buy in response to a change in the price, is   smaller in percentage   terms.   For   example,   a   10%   increase in price leads to less than a   10% decrease in   the   quantity bought.   The   other possibility   is   that the demand for your product is “elastic”, in which case your total   sales revenue   will   fall. This means that the change in the number of   units consumers buy   in response to   a   change   in      the price, is larger in percentage terms. For example, a   10% increase   in price   leads   to more   than   a   10% decrease in the quantity bought. Therefore, by knowing the elasticity of   demand   for your   product at your current selling price, you can predict how changes in your product price will affect   total   sales   revenue."
